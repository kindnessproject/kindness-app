There's a quote by JM Barrie that goes, "always be a little kinder than is necessary." I think my favorite part about this is that it doesn't say who to be kind to. A lot of times, people forget to be kind to themselves.

This project is here to help communities, to bring a little more positvity to the world, but first it is also here to help you. Every day of this following year is set with one specific, feasible challenge for you to do. Every once in a while, that involves doing something for yourself. Starting today, you are going to be making the incredible changes you are capable of making. You are going to touch so many lives. And yeah, I might just be some girl behind a computer screen, but I believe in you. So smile for me.

<b>About the project:</b>

The Kindness project is a 365-day project where you have to do one nice thing everyday. The challenges vary; most are for others, some are for yourself, and many are open to interpretation. Some of the challenges take part in a recurring theme that appears throughout the year. The project is available in three types of media: a book/pdf, a calendar, and an app. The Kindness Project is part of the MYP Personal Project.

<b>About the Personal Project:</b>

The Middle Years Program (MYP) is one of the International Baccalaureate's (IB) school programs, one that is taught to students between the ages of 11-16. As part of the final year of the MYP, students are required to complete a Personal Project. For this project, students select one academic or nonacademic topic of their interest as a subject for their project. This project is completed over the course of 6 months. Students are also required to keep a process journal and have regular meetings with their supervisor.
